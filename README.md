## Deliverables
✅ Incident Response Postmortem Report  
✅ Screen Recording: AWS Configuration Steps (EC2, IAM, S3)  
✅ Cloud Security Recommendations  

## Skills Demonstrated
- AWS Infrastructure Setup (EC2, IAM Users, S3 Buckets)  
- Incident Detection and Breach Analysis  
- Drafting Technical Reports and Security Playbooks  
- Applying AWS Security Best Practices  

## Important Note
This project is part of an academic simulation and does not reflect real-world security incidents. For learning purposes only.
